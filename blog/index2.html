                <h2>Funny-bone</h2>
            </header>

            <div class="post-content">
                <p>On this day I plant my flag on the barren moon that is this website, one of quadrillions of others orbiting a planet too massive and self-centered for any one voice to influence even a single person living there, let alone its tides. It's okay; I don't do it for them, I do it for me. I do it because I want to remember. </p>

                <p>Yesterday my girlfriend asked me whether I could remember our first date. I can't even remember our most recent one. What I can remember, however, are the fights and hiccups that lead us here. It's not fun; to only have memories of the dark and dreadful. But sometimes I think that's all my brain can hold onto. And its not just with my girlfriend. Everything I can recall, everything with which I can hope to build an identity is shrouded in darkness. The story I tell myself about myself, at least as I tell it to myself now and have been so telling myself for the past year, is just one of struggle against oppression, pathology, and disease: there's the struggle against the evil and unjust politicians and systems we are apart of, a struggle against my own hangups caused by a past I imagine to be full of negativity, a battle against an illness caused by an ineffable mix of factors. And the overcoming that emerges from these struggles does not provide relief. All I achieve, all I get out of these struggles is the bare minimum, a bit of sanity and normalcy. There is nothing to be proud of.</p>

                <p>Having a memory like this isn't conducive to friendships and genuine conmections. When the only thing you can recall from your interactions with others are the criticisms, embarassing moments, and jokes you weren't in on, you don't end up with the motivation to pursue these things. Don't get me wrong, the pleasant moments are there - they occured. I know that they did. I know that I was there to experience them. I just don't remember them. All I remember is a glass-like fragility and harshness to every exchange. Words that were spoken vibrated my head as though they struck its funny-bone. </p>

                <p>And don't get me doubly wrong. I do love my friends. I'm trying really hard to show them this in a way they can understand. I'm trying really hard to do more of it because I know it's ultimately good for me... and them! It's just an uphill battle. I've gotten so much better about it. But I can tell in their faces sometimes that they're suspicious of me. They don't think I care genuinely; they think that my friendship is temporary. Maybe if I write it all down, focusing especially on the good, maybe I'll prove them (and myself) wrong about me. </p>

                <h3>What I'm Working On</h3>
                <p>Currently, I'm focused on building simple HTML games and learning JavaScript. It's been really exciting to see how much you can do with just vanilla JS.</p>

                <p>My goals for this blog:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Document my learning journey</li>
                    <li>Share useful resources I discover</li>
                    <li>Build at least one game per month</li>
                </ul>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"The best way to learn programming is to build projects you're excited about."</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>I'm excited to see where this journey takes me. Thanks for following along!</p>

                <h2>Learning HTML Games</h2>
            </header>

            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Today I started working on my first HTML game using the Canvas API. It's amazing how much you can do with just vanilla JavaScript!</p>

                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How to draw on HTML Canvas</li>
                    <li>Game loop fundamentals</li>
                    <li>Event handling for user input</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Here's a simple example of drawing a moving square:</p>
                <pre><code>const canvas = document.getElementById('gameCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

let x = 50, y = 50;

function gameLoop() {
    // Clear canvas
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
    
    // Draw square
    ctx.fillStyle = 'blue';
    ctx.fillRect(x, y, 30, 30);
    
    // Move square
    x += 2;
    if (x > canvas.width) x = 0;
    
    requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
}

gameLoop();</code></pre>

                <p>Next, I want to add collision detection and make it interactive. The possibilities are endless!</p>

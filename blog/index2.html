        <h2>Jeremie</h2>
    </header>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I forgot that the whole purpose of this blog was to help me remember pleasant memories.</p>

        <p>I have an excellent friend named Jeremie. Jeremie is an old high school friend. We live in different provinces now. We play video games together every Thursday. I can prove to you that Jeremie is excellent.</p>

        <p>In my very late teens, I became very sick. My digestive system fell apart. And when your digestive system is falling apart, the last thing you want to do is leave your house. You become resentful and frustrated. You become disfigured - the medicine I was taking bloated my face and made it hairy. You lose weight. You become disgusted with your body. You feel a lot of shame.</p>

        <p>Jeremie was the only friend I had who noticed me disappearing off the map. He texted me one day during that summer when things really fell apart for me. I wish I still had the text. He wanted to come over to check in.</p>

        <p>I remember getting really angry and telling him not to come. I didn't want to see anybody. He insisted. Next thing I knew he was ringing our - my parents' - doorbell.</p>

        <p>I wish I could remember what we talked about. Did I share anything about my mental state? My feelings? My depression? I don't think I knew I was depressed. I probably just said something like: "Yeah I'm sick with something; I'm seeing a doctor. We'll figure it out." I don't think he stayed long - I probably gave the impression he was intruding.</p>

        <p>It's hard to label this a happy or pleasant memory. I remember it was a sunny day; I remember looking down the hallway towards the front door and seeing the blurred outline of my friend through the frosted glass. I remember we spoke on the porch; I think he was only stopping by for a minute. I don't remember what I was feeling; I don't think I was consciously feeling anything; I was a pretty repressed person - I think that has something to do with why I became so sick. But looking back at it, I do feel enormous gratitude. It's one of many memories that evokes a sort of disbelief; it seems unthinkable that someone could put up with me in moments like that, when I was so overwhelmed by my illness that I couldn't even properly acknowledge the illness itself.</p>

        <p>More about Jeremie. Probably during Covid, when our gaming sessions really took off, I must have been complaining routinely about the non-existence of banana soda. How could society pass through every fruit flavor and move on to bubble gum without giving banana its due. Doesn't everybody love those banana marshmallow candy things?</p>

        <p>Skip to Christmas Day at my sister's house, I shove my hand into my stocking and pull out two cans of banana-fucking-soda. That motherfucker had ordered some online, then driven to my parents' house (okay, I redact my statement that this occurred during Covid: Jeremie did not undertake intercity travel during the travel ban) to ask them to put it in my stocking on Christmas Eve. I nearly cried.</p>

        <p>This hadn't been the first time Jeremie made an impromptu visit to my parents' house to check in. He's even done this when I was away and just hung out with my parents to work with them on my mom's yearly Christmas jigsaw.</p>

        <p>Jeremie deserves the best and only the best. Any misfortune happening to Jeremie only serves to prove that God doesn't exist. Jeremie likes to keep his pool heated to the modest temperature of 34 degrees Celsius.</p>

        <h2>Always projecting</h2>
    </header>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I'm reading through scripts of my favorite TV show, scrutinizing for difference between them and the actual show. I found several. Each of them stimulates a juicy pleasure spot in my brain. "Aha! I knew it!" What did I know? I'm proving to myself that no draft - no plan concocted in imagination or on paper - ever perfectly resembles the final product. No writer has the complete creation in mind before setting his pen down. Execution creates new ideas, new considerations, new jokes. And so if there are differences between the script and the show, that means that somewhere in between, something was edited because something wasn't perfect. It also suggests that even between the imagined work and the written script, changes must have been made.</p>

        <p>It's kind of obsessive; this need I have to prove that nobody on their own - in their own head - can conceive of a perfect work of art.</p>

        <p>I did the same thing with Dylan a while back. If you're a Dylan fan, you get the special privilege of having access to countless takes and incomplete versions of so many of your favorite artist's songs. (If you're not a Dylan fan, you might question the sanity of people listening to these takes.) There are takes with different groves, melodies, and most importantly, lyrics. You get to hear songs that didn't make the studio albums, some of these songs containing lyrics, sometimes whole verses, to songs on those studio albums, as though the latter were assembled from the former like a Frankenstein monster. So even Dylan, who in some sense strived to generate the allure of "I don't give a shit about perfection", intentionally reworked his songs to death. It takes a ton of work to make something sound effortless and improvised.</p>

        <p>I hear you; you think this need I have to prove this point is psychotic. I do too, to be honest - at least partially. I of course know that no first draft is perfect. No last draft is even perfect. No first take is perfect, no last take is perfect. And not only that: I know that multiple people interject themselves at every stage of the process with their notes and suggestions. Every product is the result of dozens of interactions, and is reviewed and slept on by dozens of people. Editors, engineers, supervisors, co-authors, co-creators. Iteration after iteration. I know all of this.</p>

        <p>Still, there's this driving engine deep in my psyche that equates genius with the ability to speak or produce a perfect creation on the very first try. Like God snapping his fingers and creating man. I guess part of me is convinced that if my first take - the first iteration - isn't flawless, then I am deeply flawed and I may as well give up. If I didn't believe this, I wouldn't be so obsessed with finding evidence to the contrary.</p>

        <p>Why am I looking so intensely for reassurance about this? Here's my working theory, and it's not pretty.</p>

        <p>I think I'm worried that nobody else gets this point - gets that it requires a village. I think most people have this same delusional voice in their heads telling them that genius' did it all alone on the first try. Only I also think that such people haven't reflected on the absurdity of this voice - they endorse it. So I'm constantly seeking evidence against them in case the argument comes up. "You're so weak for asking for help". Buddy, anyone worth anything asks for help.</p>

        <p>Okay so maybe <em>I'm</em> not psychotic. I'm rather worried that <em>everyone else</em> is, and so I'm building a defense against their psychoticism. It's fine... I'm paranoid that's all.</p>

        <p>It is ironic, though - the voice is so persistent in me that I'm projecting it onto everyone else and assuming they're incapable of seeing through it. Am I even capable? If I were, I wouldn't be constantly seeking evidence against it. I wouldn't feel the need to argue against anyone. At the same time, I <em>know</em> the whole idea I'm trying to disprove is ludicrous. So maybe I am capable? Maybe I'm both capable and incapable?</p>

        <h2>Stakes</h2>
    </header>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I wanted to be a musician - a singer/songwriter-type fellow. I still do. But I used to actively pursue it. Now that's a high stakes ambition. You work on lyrics and melodies, fancy but not too fancy chord progressions and then you rehearse for hours - so many hours. Then you perform, just you and your guitar. Just your whole identity versus an audience. Your show better be good. How else could you justify that time?</p>

        <p>There's something especially unnerving about singing. It has a strange relation to your identity in contrast to other forms of artistic expression. People don't tend to say "you need to work more at your craft" when it comes to the voice. They might say that about a painter. A singer, it is said, just does or doesn't have a good voice. It's not that you sing bad, you're bad. It's a permanent identifying feature of a person. This, by the way, is definitely not true. But it's definitely what is said. And it definitely hurts to witness someone offended by the mere sound of your voice.</p>

        <p>Naturally I gave up on this dream - I've never not blacked out during a performance. It's my favorite thing in the world to do at home alone, but in front of people, it feels like I'm fighting to the death. My identity was at stake.</p>

        <p>So let's lower those stakes. I need to be a creative. But not one which creates in front of a live audience. Writing works. What's a low stakes kind of writing. Being a novelist definitely isn't. You risk being so broke. You have to leave your house to be a journalist. Academic writing though, now that's got an allure. You're protected by a huge institution. There's always teaching jobs for someone with that kind of degree. And if you do succeed, you'll be read by, what, 100 people at most? That's if you're really successful. Initially, only your supervisor will read you. I think I can manage that.</p>

        <p>That's it then - I'll be an academic philosopher. But not just any, not a cutting-edge one who discusses pressing issues. Not someone who presumes to be able to change the tides on an ethical debate. No, I'll be a historian of philosophy. I'll comment on the already discarded. Everything I say will be sheltered by some of history's greatests - I'll be like a baby kangaroo seeing the world from my mom's pouch. If what I say is wrong, it will be because some old white dude from the past got it wrong; I'm just a passenger.</p>

        <p>I can go lower though. Come to think about it, having a well-established scholar as a supervisor who reads my creations sounds terrifying. Just knowing, with certainty, that someone will look at me is scary. But I can't just hide my creations from everybody either. I'd vanish.</p>

        <p>So what if I find a way to put myself out there such that there is only the minutest probability that someone will look - some infinitesimal chance of harsh judgment. I need to feel discoverable without feeling like I'm risking something.</p>

        <p>Don't find me out. Or do find me out, but only if it's good. Then tell me - tell everyone. Otherwise, pretend you didn't see nothing.</p>

        <p>I'm pathetic and this is my blog.</p>

                <h2>Sit up!</h2>
            </header>
            <div class="post-content">

                    <p>For a while there was a quasi-daily reoccurrence of splattered shit on the far side of the toilet seat in the only stall at work. Then most folks left for their summer vacation, and everything was clean. I know it's one of two specific new guys in the deparment. They're both non-westerners. So on this day I ask 'is this what multiculturalism is like?'. I'm half joking. Like I'm aware that toilets are different in other countries, and that their toilets are probably just as good as ours. I'm not here to judge their toilets. 
                    But there's clearly a <i>correct</i> way to shit on <i>our</i> toilets.</p>
                
                    <p>What am I supposed to do? Put up a sign on the back of the stall door with a drawing depicting how to shit? Isn't that insensitive? Do I really have to walk this wild line between cultural sensibilities and proper shitting practices. Even a general, non-specific institute-wide email would be so weird. So would doing what Clifford Maine does in Better Call Saul when Saul avoids flushing after number 2 in order to get canned. </p>
                    
                   
                    <p> Also, how does one use the bathroom like that, then look at the result, and not think "maybe I'm doing something wrong...". I guess it's the era of relativism - there is no wrong or right. Naw, multiculturalism can't mean that you can enter a culture and not minimally atune yourself to its practices - particularly its shitting practices. Sit your ass down, buddy, right on the seat. And don't lean forward. </p>
                    
                    
                    <p>And, of course, I am writing this from the throne. </p>

                <h2>What a shame</h2>
            </header>

            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I still can't tell the difference between someone who is aware of their mask, and someone who isn't, and someone who is aware of it but in denial about it, and those pleasant people who can take one off and put on a new one when it's called for.</p>

                <p>There's a guy at work who definitely doesn't see it. He's all structure and form. "This is not appropriate behaviour for the workplace" he said this one time. We're creatives - how could you draw that line? I respect him though, he's really good at getting people to clean up after themselves.</p>

                <p>I used to be so afraid of authority - afraid of disappointing people, really. In high school, I wouldn't have been caught dead breaking the rules. I was always an overachiever, not because I had too, but because to disappoint the teacher or my parents would have been absolutely, utterly, bone-rattlingly devastating. Recognition from an authority meant everything to me. Shame is a powerful motivator. </p>

                <p>Then little by little, the veil fell apart. Looking back, I'd have to place the seed of my disillusionment in my frustrations against referees during the hockey games of my early teens. I used to howl and wile out at these refs. They were only kids, barely older than I. But they were so bad at their jobs; and people in positions of authority failing to mete out justice were, to this young teen, the worst kinds of people. Absolute frauds. </p>

                <p>I'd get so uncharacteristically violent and outspoken during these games. Yelling turned into overly aggressive checking and punching. In all other facets, I was a sweet, innocent boy.</p>

                <p>Then I came to despise the 'greater institutions.' The university was one. Being taught by professors who could barely speak English sent my temper flying. This was supposed to be an institution where I come to learn and the people teaching had no teaching skills at all. How the fuck does that make sense? I wrote a rant about it on the Blackberry I used at the time; I can't find it anymore. The gist of it had to do with the fact that I was being ordered to take the 'serious' people seriously, when all I could see were clowns. </p>

                <p>It was 2013; I was 19. I complained about it to my dad, just like I had complained so many times before about those referees. His response: "That's just the way things are. What are you gonna do, change the world?" </p>
                <p>I didn't know what I was going to do. I stayed in school and I'm not sure how my thinking evolved in the aftermath. I am sure I became terribly sick though. My digestive track fell apart. </p>

                <p>I guess I'm on a quest to recover that wildly outspoken boy who never failed to give the referees a piece of his mind. Or at least recover the ability to express a momentary thought or emotion without worrying about being pinned down by it. Unrestrained emoting felt so good.  These days the idea of externalizing anything inside my head is a non-starter.</p>

                <h2>Funny bone</h2>
            </header>

            <div class="post-content">
                <p>On this day I plant my flag on the barren moon that is this website, one of quadrillions of others orbiting a planet too massive and self-centered for any one voice to influence even its tides, let alone a single person living there. It's okay; I don't do it for them, I do it for me. I do it because I want to remember. </p>

                <p>Yesterday my girlfriend asked me whether I could remember our first date. I can't even remember our most recent one. What I can remember, however, are the fights and hiccups that lead us here. It's not fun; to only have memories of the dark and dreadful. But sometimes I think that's all my brain can hold onto. And its not just with my girlfriend. Everything I can recall, everything with which I can hope to build an identity is shrouded in darkness. The story I tell myself about myself, at least as I tell it to myself now and have been so telling myself for the past year, is just one of struggle against oppression, pathology, and disease: there's the struggle against the evil and unjust politicians and systems we are apart of, a struggle against my own hangups caused by a past I imagine to be full of negativity, a battle against an illness caused by an ineffable mix of factors. And the overcoming that emerges from these struggles does not provide relief. All I achieve, all I get out of these struggles is the bare minimum, a bit of sanity and normalcy. There is nothing to be proud of.</p>

                <p>On top of that, having a memory like this isn't conducive to friendships and genuine conmections. When the only thing you can recall from your interactions with others are the criticisms, embarassing moments, and jokes you weren't in on, you don't end up with the motivation to pursue these things. Don't get me wrong, the pleasant moments are there - they occured. I know that they did. I know that I was there to experience them. I just don't remember them. All I remember is a glass-like fragility and harshness to every exchange. Hollow words that were spoken and that vibrated my head as though they struck its funny bone. </p>

                <p>And don't get me doubly wrong. I do love my friends. I'm trying really hard to show them this in a way they can understand. I'm trying really hard to do more of it because I know it's ultimately good for me... and them! It's just an uphill battle. I've gotten so much better about it. But I can tell in their faces sometimes that they're suspicious of me. They don't think I care genuinely; they think that my friendship is temporary. Maybe if I write it all down, focusing especially on the good, maybe I'll prove them (and myself) wrong about me. </p>

                <h3>What I'm Working On</h3>
                <p>Currently, I'm focused on building simple HTML games and learning JavaScript. It's been really exciting to see how much you can do with just vanilla JS.</p>

                <p>My goals for this blog:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Document my learning journey</li>
                    <li>Share useful resources I discover</li>
                    <li>Build at least one game per month</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Learning HTML Games</h2>
            </header>

            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Today I started working on my first HTML game using the Canvas API. It's amazing how much you can do with just vanilla JavaScript!</p>

                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How to draw on HTML Canvas</li>
                    <li>Game loop fundamentals</li>
                    <li>Event handling for user input</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Here's a simple example of drawing a moving square:</p>
                <pre><code>const canvas = document.getElementById('gameCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

let x = 50, y = 50;

function gameLoop() {
    // Clear canvas
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
    
    // Draw square
    ctx.fillStyle = 'blue';
    ctx.fillRect(x, y, 30, 30);
    
    // Move square
    x += 2;
    if (x > canvas.width) x = 0;
    
    requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
}

gameLoop();</code></pre>

                <p>Next, I want to add collision detection and make it interactive. The possibilities are endless!</p>

                <h2>What a shame</h2>
            </header>

            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I still can't tell the difference between someone who is aware of their mask, and someone who isn't, and someone who is aware of it but in denial about it, and those pleasant people who can take one off and put on a new one when it's called for.</p>

                <p>There's a guy at work who definitely doesn't see it. He's all structure and form. "This is not appropriate behaviour for the workplace" he said this one time. We're creatives - how could you draw that line? I respect him though, he's really good at getting people to clean up after themselves.</p>

                <p>I used to be so afraid of authority - afraid of disappointing people, really. In high school, I wouldn't have been caught dead breaking the rules. I was always an overachiever, not because I had too, but because to disappoint the teacher or my parents would have been absolutely, utterly, bone-rattlingly devastating. Recognition from an authority meant everything to me. Shame is a powerful motivator. </p>

                <p>Then little by little, the veil fell apart. Looking back, I'd have to place the seed of my disillusionment in my frustrations against referees during the hockey games of my early teens. I used to howl and wile out at these refs. They were only kids, barely older than I. But they were so bad at their jobs; and people in positions of authority failing to mete out justice were, to this young teen, the worst kinds of people. Absolute frauds. </p>

                <p>I'd get so uncharacteristically violent and outspoken during these games. Yelling turned into overly aggressive checking and punching. In all other facets, I was a sweet, innocent boy.</p>

                <p>Then I came to despise the 'greater institutions.' The university was one. Being taught by professors who could barely speak English sent my temper flying. This was supposed to be an institution where I come to learn and the people teaching had no teaching skills at all. How the fuck does that make sense? I wrote a rant about it on the Blackberry I used at the time; I can't find it anymore. The gist of it had to do with the fact that I was being ordered to take the 'serious' people seriously, when all I could see were clowns. </p>

                <p>It was 2013; I was 19. I complained about it to my dad, just like I had complained so many times before about those referees. His response: "That's just the way things are. What are you gonna do, change the world?" </p>
                <p>I didn't know what I was going to do. I stayed in school and I'm not sure how my thinking evolved in the aftermath. I am sure I became terribly sick though. My digestive track fell apart. </p>

                <p>I guess I'm on a quest to recover that wildly outspoken boy who never failed to give the referees a piece of his mind. I remember it feeling so good. These days the idea of externalizing anything inside my head is a non-starter.</p>

                <h2>Funny bone</h2>
            </header>

            <div class="post-content">
                <p>On this day I plant my flag on the barren moon that is this website, one of quadrillions of others orbiting a planet too massive and self-centered for any one voice to influence even its tides, let alone a single person living there. It's okay; I don't do it for them, I do it for me. I do it because I want to remember. </p>

                <p>Yesterday my girlfriend asked me whether I could remember our first date. I can't even remember our most recent one. What I can remember, however, are the fights and hiccups that lead us here. It's not fun; to only have memories of the dark and dreadful. But sometimes I think that's all my brain can hold onto. And its not just with my girlfriend. Everything I can recall, everything with which I can hope to build an identity is shrouded in darkness. The story I tell myself about myself, at least as I tell it to myself now and have been so telling myself for the past year, is just one of struggle against oppression, pathology, and disease: there's the struggle against the evil and unjust politicians and systems we are apart of, a struggle against my own hangups caused by a past I imagine to be full of negativity, a battle against an illness caused by an ineffable mix of factors. And the overcoming that emerges from these struggles does not provide relief. All I achieve, all I get out of these struggles is the bare minimum, a bit of sanity and normalcy. There is nothing to be proud of.</p>

                <p>On top of that, having a memory like this isn't conducive to friendships and genuine conmections. When the only thing you can recall from your interactions with others are the criticisms, embarassing moments, and jokes you weren't in on, you don't end up with the motivation to pursue these things. Don't get me wrong, the pleasant moments are there - they occured. I know that they did. I know that I was there to experience them. I just don't remember them. All I remember is a glass-like fragility and harshness to every exchange. Hollow words that were spoken and that vibrated my head as though they struck its funny bone. </p>

                <p>And don't get me doubly wrong. I do love my friends. I'm trying really hard to show them this in a way they can understand. I'm trying really hard to do more of it because I know it's ultimately good for me... and them! It's just an uphill battle. I've gotten so much better about it. But I can tell in their faces sometimes that they're suspicious of me. They don't think I care genuinely; they think that my friendship is temporary. Maybe if I write it all down, focusing especially on the good, maybe I'll prove them (and myself) wrong about me. </p>

                <h3>What I'm Working On</h3>
                <p>Currently, I'm focused on building simple HTML games and learning JavaScript. It's been really exciting to see how much you can do with just vanilla JS.</p>

                <p>My goals for this blog:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Document my learning journey</li>
                    <li>Share useful resources I discover</li>
                    <li>Build at least one game per month</li>
                </ul>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"The best way to learn programming is to build projects you're excited about."</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>I'm excited to see where this journey takes me. Thanks for following along!</p>

                <h2>Learning HTML Games</h2>
            </header>

            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Today I started working on my first HTML game using the Canvas API. It's amazing how much you can do with just vanilla JavaScript!</p>

                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How to draw on HTML Canvas</li>
                    <li>Game loop fundamentals</li>
                    <li>Event handling for user input</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Here's a simple example of drawing a moving square:</p>
                <pre><code>const canvas = document.getElementById('gameCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

let x = 50, y = 50;

function gameLoop() {
    // Clear canvas
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
    
    // Draw square
    ctx.fillStyle = 'blue';
    ctx.fillRect(x, y, 30, 30);
    
    // Move square
    x += 2;
    if (x > canvas.width) x = 0;
    
    requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
}

gameLoop();</code></pre>

                <p>Next, I want to add collision detection and make it interactive. The possibilities are endless!</p>

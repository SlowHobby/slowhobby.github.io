        <h2>Obliterated</h2>
    </header>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I'm so fucking terrified of everything. My supervisor, my friends, women, myself. I hear myself say things and immediately think "what a fucking dumb thing to say". I witness a thought appear and I'm already on top of it, beating it down for existing. My loudest voice is the one that demands silence. "Don't say anything. Don't exist, not even as a thought. Shut it down."</p>

        <p>I can't even bring this up with my therapist. The thought of doing so engages all the defense mechanisms I'm trying to get rid of. "You're being so dramatic. You don't believe what you're about to say. D'you know how abused you'd have to be for this to be true about you?"</p>

        <p>There it is: the thought that I'm overly self-critical is met with hyper(meta?)-self-criticism. "You're an idiot for thinking that you're overly self-critical."</p>

        <p>I'm going to bring it up with him anyway. I'll just read it - I'll definitely accompany it with all the same caveats.</p>

        <p>He'll want evidence, presumably. Here I go again looking for justifications for my feelings and preferences. Let's oblige the dysfunction.</p>

        <p>First, I'm sitting at work writing this because I've been obsessed with journaling for the past week. I'd be crying if I were at home - that's how intense the feeling is right now, that's how true it feels for me. Remember that for when you stone-facedly report it to your therapist.</p>

        <p>I haven't worked in three weeks.</p>

        <p>Here's another one: It has become hard to even listen to music - the thing I love most in the world - because it's a reminder that I gave up being a musician out of fear and self-abnegation.</p>

        <p>This feels so performative. Maybe because I spend too much time in an area of the internet where everyone else also seems to feel this way. There I go making excuses again.</p>

        <p>Five minutes later, and I feel fine. So why mention it at all? It only comes in short hiccups throughout the week. Nothing worthy of reporting.</p>

        <p>Next Wednesday is a long ways away.</p>

        <h2>Don't be so selfish</h2>
    </header>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I haven't done any dissertation work for the past two weeks. Normally I'd be okay with this. I tend to work 7-days a week year-round, so the occasional break feels acceptable. But as of today I'm feeling a strange kind of guilt about not working. It's not enough to get me to start working again but definitely enough to prevent me from doing the other stuff I enjoy. I'm left sitting at my desk, shuffling my seriously worn-out deck of cards, and waiting for my brain to start tickling again.</p>

        <p>The problem is that this time, I'm feeling a subtle amount of dread that I can't quite place. I am used to saying so ironically, but today it has hit me in the teeth with the genuine sting of a stepped-on rake: writing this PhD dissertation is the most soul-sucking, tedious, joyless thing ever - it's on the level of alphabetizing the files in the filing cabinets of the dusty and poorly lit storage room at your doctor's office - it connects me with nothing and no one at all, in fact it's the most alienating thing I've ever done.</p>

        <p>It's really worrisome. It feels like the re-emergence of a thought-pattern I thought I'd put to rest: the one where I obsess over something, burnout or get bored, realize it's not for me, change career path, repeat - all in the name of authentic living! It was me noticing this pattern that in part led me to commit so intently to pursuing a PhD. One modest existential crisis later, I realized that I had accomplished nothing with this MO. So I got out of the rut by committing myself to a pursuit that seemed larger than me, something I thought worthwhile. And since then this pursuit has been the all-supporting backdrop to my life, enabling me to manage the other perhaps more minor battles with authenticity that I've faced.</p>

        <p>That's the dread then, it's the terrifying possibility that what I thought was a permanent fixture - something that has kept me grounded - is finally fading away: What if this is a burnout warranting a total change of course? What if this career path was a mistake after all? (Is this what a breakup feels like?)</p>

        <p>Stating this out loud has made me realize how ridiculous the sentiment is. It has reminded me that almost every moment along this journey has been one filled with excitement, discoveries, epiphanies, about society, humanity, and history and even about myself. For the past five years, it has been true for me without question that I was destined for this. Isn't that enough to justify staying the course?</p>

        <p>Maybe it's framing with respect to authenticity that's what's screwing me over. Maybe it's time for some tough love. Here's a thought: this tedium that's now pressing itself into my face is just the price I have to pay for the privilege of pursuing this degree. What I am truly confronting now - this lull - is the fact that my <em>job</em> is take all these wonderful discoveries and weave them together into a coherent, readable text that other people can learn from. It's true that it's tedious but it is required - I should share my findings with others, I owe it to them - otherwise what am I to them? Probably just a selfish blob leeching off the system. Or the worst thing of all: a mere consumer. (High pitched scream in the distance.)</p>

        <p>So this <em>isn't</em> a battle with authenticity. Or maybe it's a need to reconfigure the basis for authenticity. The fact of the matter is that if I am inferring from my boredom that I've chosen the wrong path because the correct - authentic - one could never make me feel like this then I am making a huge selfish mistake. Wait a minute - have I been doing this my whole life? Have I been masquerading my lack of productivity, my constant changes in direction, as a quest for authenticity, when it's really an unconscious drive to absorb the world while contributing nothing?</p>

        <p>That seems too harsh. I can admit that authenticity is important to me and has driven me towards this awesome fulfilling career while also admitting I'm part of a community, one that I care about and need to care for. In fact, this realization helps a lot: I now have a new reason to share my findings - to share any of my creations really - that doesn't come from the mere selfish desire to be recognized as a creator. I have a duty to share which stems from a desire to <em>not</em> be selfish - a duty to contribute and not merely consume.</p>

        <p>I need to think this over more. One thing that sticks is that if I'm always dipping my toe in a ton of different hobbies without giving back, then I'm really nothing good for my community.</p>

        <p>So this is something new to latch onto: I should ground my motivation to finish the things I start in duty to share my creations and to contribute.</p>

        <h2>Blue cedar</h2>
    </header>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I now have a favorite tree. I discovered it while walking through the cemetery neighboring my apartment building. The building and cemetery are part of a relatively small bundle of apartment buildings and houses sprawling on top a hill overlooking the Costco. I don't think I'm doxing myself by saying it's called Mount Pleasant Cemetery.</p>

        <p>I like to say I live in this cemetery. Both because the apartment buildings themselves are lined up like tombstones and because eighty percent of the tenants here are seniors. Also because of the cemetery.</p>

        <p>The tree is an Eastern Red Cedar. I had to look up that name. The bark is really grey and feels soft, like it would peel off easily if you pulled, and the scales are a cool shade of faded blue. I think it's now my favorite shade of blue. What's special about the one in the cemetery is that it has none of the symmetry of those you find in images on the internet. There's a long stretch of bare trunk before the branches split off haphazardly. It's definitely been the victim of several wind storms. If I had a house with a backyard, I'd have a bunch of these trees. Maybe I'd deliberately break off some of its branches to reproduce the look I like. And the whole backyard would be wild and overgrown with rough path carpeted in rusting pine needles. I'd want it to feel like you're deep in a northern forest.</p>

        <p>There's a brown tombstone here from 1879 with a name I can't make out. It has been here too long for anyone to still be bringing it flowers. Instead, a bunch of mushrooms have started to grow out of the earth surrounding it. It feels appropriate. It's what I'd want. Nobody bring me flowers when I'm gone. Instead, break up the mycelium of your favorite mushroom and mix it into the earth above me. Find some colorful ones.</p>
        <p>My brother-in-law owns an acreage. "Sixty-five Acres." He spends all his free time chiseling away at it. This includes flattening a whole area to dig himself small lake where the kids can swim. He threw in some fish to keep it vibrant. It's one of my favorite places to be. When they first moved in, I helped him clear out some of the many four-wheeler trails that had become overgrown from neglect by the previous owner. He has a habit of clearing out everything including the old stumps that aren't obviously in the way. If they're small and decayed enough, he'll yank them out with his bare hands. I've seen him pressure-wash a boulder. Boulders are actually quite beautiful.</p>

                    <h2>Evil eye</h2>
                </header>

                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>They're old. They're boring. Their crisis right now - their story of the moment - is that some car salesman lied about the possibility of permanently moving their SUV to Canada. Why would I want to hang out with them? Okay, that's a little mean; it'd probably be a real stressor for me too. I'd probably be ranting about the injustice to anyone around. But I'm trying to teach myself something here, and sometimes latching onto an exaggeration - a demonization - goes a long way. Telling kids that pot will deflate their body, melting it into the couch, and make their friends pout is a good way to get them to think twice about a drug that for some is energizing and in all cases will make them look cool. So long as there's a kernel of truth, it'll make you pause, and so long as you pause, there's room for change.</p>

                    <p>Here's the change I'd like to undergo: I'd like to feel comfortable again doing drugs, sitting on a friend's couch. It's a modest goal and I'm sure it's super relatable. I used to do it without hesitation in my early twenties. I used to walk into class high as a kite. I once did mushrooms with a friend and we walked up Mount Royal some busy Friday evening.</p>

                    <p>Then something happened in my mid twenties. I have a theory about it. If you've been reading this blog, you'll notice I have a lot of theories. This one is kind of convoluted. It involves a man - an emotionally repressed one - working hard at learning to reflexively feel his emotions, achieving this ability to a certain extent, then being completely overwhelmed and paralyzed by the intensity of these newly felt emotions - emotions that for the first time are being allowed to be felt. This man needs to learn to manage these emotions without repressing them.</p>

                    <p>One of these newly felt feelings is shame - oh boy there's a lot of it and oh boy is it toxic. It's a shame that prevents me from living my truth in the moment, from expressing my preferences without self-censorship or judgment, and from doing drugs - yummy gummy drugs. There's an evil eye following me everywhere I go that I just became aware of and that I need to shake... or at least accept it. Now one way to feel comfortable in one's skin when an evil eye is watching you is to have an elaborate justification for everything you feel, think, like, and do. This pleases the evil eye.</p>

                    <p>Okay so why did I start this by talking about old folks and SUVs? I don't actually think the people I have in mind are boring - or old. But I'm feeling guilty or shame about preferring others to them and wanting to skip a hangout every once in a while. I need to learn to stop feeling this shame. Actually -- ooh, here's the juicy insight -- I need to do this <em>without making a monster out of them</em>. Hanging out with SUV-owners won't cause my body to deflate. I don't need some grand explanatory scheme to justify a preference. I can just have a preference. There's nothing wrong with saying "meh, not for me". Nobody should take that personally. I'd prefer to hang out with confused like-minded people. I'd prefer to avoid the overly-guarded. It's okay that I prefer this. There is no shame in having preferences. I'd prefer to follow my bliss. I'd prefer to have a midlife crisis at 35 than 45.</p>

                    <p>You hear (see) that, you dumb evil eye? I don't care what you think!</p>

                    <p>Hey, where did it go? Oh, it's just me.</p>

                    <h2>Oxytocin deprivation</h2>
                </header>

                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>I don't think I'm capable of missing someone. As far as I can describe it, what happens is I get oxytocin deprived.</p>

                    <p>My girlfriend has gone home for two weeks - a little family reunion. I'm not there because I've got blogging to do.</p>

                    <p>What I feel about it is this: I wake up tired. My eyes feel prickly and misplaced. I sort of want to cry at odd times of the day, but I don't think I could if I tried. I know this sounds like some teenage heartbreak thing - like I'm missing the sweetheart I met at summer camp. But what's weird is that it doesn't feel directed at anything, not even at my girlfriend. It's not a wish she'd come back. It's just an impersonal sadness. I don't miss anyone - I'm just upset. But it's got to be caused by her absence, no?</p>

                    <p>I wanted to stay home and sulk last night but I forced myself to go out with some new friends. The heat wave is finally over; I had to wear a jacket.</p>

                    <p>Because of my rut, I was struggling to make eye contact with people. Everyone was friendly though.
                    And despite most of us being just newly acquainted, we spent the evening talking about our insecurities, our relationships to our emotions, to our parents. It was super pleasant. Four out of five of us take prescription medication because of some psychological diagnosis. Depression, anxiety, ADHD. We just needed a schizophrenic.</p>

                    <p>I discovered someone who even though he has the most emotionally available parents I've ever heard of - parents who would regularly commiserate and cry with him - still suffers from anxiety and digestive issues.</p>

                    <p>What's the lesson to take from that... it definitely puts a wrench in my working theory about myself and my upbringing. My mother's side of the family suffers from digestive issues. They're also the most emotionally repressed people I know. I consider myself part of that group, just so you know. None of us were taught how to manage or even recognize emotions, particularly our negative ones. So we eat them - stuff them deep down into our second brain. And shit them out uncontrollably. They become homogenized; they turn into waste. And then because what gets manifested is a physical illness, we can claim that we have no psychological dysfunctions at all. We're the sanest family, it's our bodies that are broken.</p>

                    <p>But if being raised by hippie-saints also leads to the same outcome, the theory falls apart. Unless that kind of rearing leads to its own complications, like maybe he's ill-equipped for the harsh realities my mother claims she inured us against. Maybe mine and his are two extremes of a spectrum. In any case, the narrative I've constructed for myself has brought me a fair bit of healing though - and that counts for a lot so I'm going to stick with it.</p>

                    <p>Anyways the outing seems to have partially replenished my oxytocin.</p>

                </header>

                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>I forgot that the whole purpose of this blog was to help me remember pleasant memories.</p>

                    <p>I have an excellent friend named Jeremie. Jeremie is an old high school friend. We live in different provinces now. We play video games together every Thursday. I can prove to you that Jeremie is excellent.</p>

                    <p>In my very late teens, I became very sick. My digestive system fell apart. And when your digestive system is falling apart, the last thing you want to do is leave your house. You become resentful and frustrated. You become disfigured - the medicine I was taking bloated my face and made it hairy. You lose weight. You become disgusted with your body. You feel a lot of shame.</p>

                    <p>Jeremie was the only friend I had who noticed me disappearing off the map. He texted me one day during that summer when things really fell apart for me. I wish I still had the text. He wanted to come over to check in.</p>

                    <p>I remember getting really angry and telling him not to come. I didn't want to see anybody. He insisted. Next thing I knew he was ringing our - my parents' - doorbell.</p>

                    <p>I wish I could remember what we talked about. Did I share anything about my mental state? My feelings? My depression? I don't think I knew I was depressed. I probably just said something like: "Yeah I'm sick with something; I'm seeing a doctor. We'll figure it out." I don't think he stayed long - I probably gave the impression he was intruding.</p>

                    <p>It's hard to label this a happy or pleasant memory. I remember it was a sunny day; I remember looking down the hallway towards the front door and seeing the blurred outline of my friend through the frosted glass. I remember we spoke on the porch; I think he was only stopping by for a minute. I don't remember what I was feeling; I don't think I was consciously feeling anything; I was a pretty repressed person - I think that has something to do with why I became so sick. But looking back at it, I do feel enormous gratitude. It's one of many memories that evokes a sort of disbelief; it seems unthinkable that someone could put up with me in moments like that, when I was so overwhelmed by my illness that I couldn't even properly acknowledge the illness itself.</p>

                    <p>More about Jeremie, though. Probably during Covid, when our gaming sessions really took off, I must have been complaining routinely about the non-existence of banana soda. How could society pass through every fruit flavor and move on to bubble gum without giving banana its due. Doesn't everybody love those banana marshmallow candy things?</p>

                    <p>Skip to Christmas Day at my sister's house, I shove my hand into my stocking and pull out two cans of banana-fucking-soda. That motherfucker had ordered some online, then driven to my parents' house (okay, I redact my statement that this occurred during Covid: Jeremie did not undertake intercity travel during the travel ban) to ask them to put it in my stocking on Christmas Eve. I nearly cried.</p>

                    <p>This hadn't been the first time Jeremie made an impromptu visit to my parents' house to check in. He's even done this when I was away and just hung out with my parents to work with them on my mom's yearly Christmas jigsaw.</p>

                    <p>Jeremie deserves the best and only the best. Any misfortune happening to Jeremie only serves to prove that God doesn't exist. Jeremie likes to keep his pool heated to the modest temperature of 34 degrees Celsius.</p>

                    <h2>Always projecting</h2>
                </header>

                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>I'm reading through scripts of my favorite TV show, scrutinizing for difference between them and the actual show. I found several. Each of them stimulates a juicy pleasure spot in my brain. "Aha! I knew it!" What did I know? I'm proving to myself that no draft - no plan concocted in imagination or on paper - ever perfectly resembles the final product. No writer has the complete creation in mind before setting his pen down. Execution creates new ideas, new considerations, new jokes. And so if there are differences between the script and the show, that means that somewhere in between, something was edited because something wasn't perfect. It also suggests that even between the imagined work and the written script, changes must have been made.</p>

                    <p>It's kind of obsessive; this need I have to prove that nobody on their own - in their own head - can conceive of a perfect work of art.</p>

                    <p>I did the same thing with Dylan a while back. If you're a Dylan fan, you get the special privilege of having access to countless takes and incomplete versions of so many of your favorite artist's songs. (If you're not a Dylan fan, you might question the sanity of people listening to these takes.) There are takes with different groves, melodies, and most importantly, lyrics. You get to hear songs that didn't make the studio albums, some of these songs containing lyrics, sometimes whole verses, to songs on those studio albums, as though the latter were assembled from the former like a Frankenstein monster. So even Dylan, who in some sense strived to generate the allure of "I don't give a shit about perfection", intentionally reworked his songs to death. It takes a ton of work to make something sound effortless and improvised.</p>

                    <p>I hear you; you think this need I have to prove this point is psychotic. I do too, to be honest - at least partially. I of course know that no first draft is perfect. No last draft is even perfect. No first take is perfect, no last take is perfect. And not only that: I know that multiple people interject themselves at every stage of the process with their notes and suggestions. Every product is the result of dozens of interactions, and is reviewed and slept on by dozens of people. Editors, engineers, supervisors, co-authors, co-creators. Iteration after iteration. I know all of this.</p>

                    <p>Still, there's this driving engine deep in my psyche that equates genius with the ability to speak or produce a perfect creation on the very first try. Like God snapping his fingers and creating man. I guess part of me is convinced that if my first take - the first iteration - isn't flawless, then I am deeply flawed and I may as well give up. If I didn't believe this, I wouldn't be so obsessed with finding evidence to the contrary.</p>

                    <p>Why am I looking so intensely for reassurance about this? Here's my working theory, and it's not pretty.</p>

                    <p>I think I'm worried that nobody else gets this point - gets that it requires a village. I think most people have this same delusional voice in their heads telling them that genius' did it all alone on the first try. Only I also think that such people haven't reflected on the absurdity of this voice - they endorse it. So I'm constantly seeking evidence against them in case the argument comes up. "You're so weak for asking for help". Buddy, anyone worth anything asks for help.</p>

                    <p>Okay so maybe <em>I'm</em> not psychotic. I'm rather worried that <em>everyone else</em> is, and so I'm building a defense against their psychoticism. It's fine... I'm paranoid that's all.</p>

                    <p>It is ironic, though - the voice is so persistent in me that I'm projecting it onto everyone else and assuming they're incapable of seeing through it. Am I even capable? If I were, I wouldn't be constantly seeking evidence against it. I wouldn't feel the need to argue against anyone. At the same time, I <em>know</em> the whole idea I'm trying to disprove is ludicrous. So maybe I am capable? Maybe I'm both capable and incapable?</p>

                    <h2>Stakes</h2>
                </header>

                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>I wanted to be a musician - a singer/songwriter-type fellow. I still do. But I used to actively pursue it. Now that's a high stakes ambition. You work on lyrics and melodies, fancy but not too fancy chord progressions and then you rehearse for hours - so many hours. Then you perform, just you and your guitar. Just your whole identity versus an audience. Your show better be good. How else could you justify that time?</p>

                    <p>There's something especially unnerving about singing. It has a strange relation to your identity in contrast to other forms of artistic expression. People don't tend to say "you need to work more at your craft" when it comes to the voice. They might say that about a painter. A singer, it is said, just does or doesn't have a good voice. It's not that you sing bad, you're bad. It's a permanent identifying feature of a person. This, by the way, is definitely not true. But it's definitely what is said. And it definitely hurts to witness someone offended by the mere sound of your voice.</p>

                    <p>Naturally I gave up on this dream - I've never not blacked out during a performance. It's my favorite thing in the world to do at home alone, but in front of people, it feels like I'm fighting to the death. My identity was at stake.</p>

                    <p>So let's lower those stakes. I need to be a creative. But not one which creates in front of a live audience. Writing works. What's a low stakes kind of writing. Being a novelist definitely isn't. You risk being so broke. You have to leave your house to be a journalist. Academic writing though, now that's got an allure. You're protected by a huge institution. There's always teaching jobs for someone with that kind of degree. And if you do succeed, you'll be read by, what, 100 people at most? That's if you're really successful. Initially, only your supervisor will read you. I think I can manage that.</p>

                    <p>That's it then - I'll be an academic philosopher. But not just any, not a cutting-edge one who discusses pressing issues. Not someone who presumes to be able to change the tides on an ethical debate. No, I'll be a historian of philosophy. I'll comment on the already discarded. Everything I say will be sheltered by some of history's greatests - I'll be like a baby kangaroo seeing the world from my mom's pouch. If what I say is wrong, it will be because some old white dude from the past got it wrong; I'm just a passenger.</p>

                    <p>I can go lower though. Come to think about it, having a well-established scholar as a supervisor who reads my creations sounds terrifying. Just knowing, with certainty, that someone will look at me is scary. But I can't just hide my creations from everybody either. I'd vanish.</p>

                    <p>So what if I find a way to put myself out there such that there is only the minutest probability that someone will look - some infinitesimal chance of harsh judgment. I need to feel discoverable without feeling like I'm risking something.</p>

                    <p>Don't find me out. Or do find me out, but only if it's good. Then tell me - tell everyone. Otherwise, pretend you didn't see nothing.</p>

                    <p>I'm pathetic and this is my blog.</p>

                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>For a while there was a quasi-daily reoccurrence of splattered shit on the far side of the toilet seat in the only stall at work. Then most folks left for their summer vacation, and everything was clean. I know it's one of two specific new guys in the deparment. They're both non-westerners. So on this day I ask 'is this what multiculturalism is like?'. I'm half joking. Like I'm aware that toilets are different in other countries, and that their toilets are probably just as good as ours. I'm not here to judge their toilets. 
                    But there's clearly a <i>correct</i> way to shit on <i>our</i> toilets.</p>
                
                    <p>What am I supposed to do? Put up a sign on the back of the stall door with a drawing depicting how to shit? Isn't that insensitive? Do I really have to walk this wild line between cultural sensibilities and proper shitting practices. Even a general, non-specific institute-wide email would be so weird. So would doing what Clifford Maine does in Better Call Saul when Saul avoids flushing after number two in order to get canned. </p>
                   
                    <p> Also, how does one use the bathroom like that, then look at the result, and not think "maybe I'm doing something wrong...". I guess it's the era of relativism - there is no wrong or right. No, that can't be right; multiculturalism can't mean that you can enter a culture and not minimally atune yourself to its practices - particularly its shitting practices. Sit your ass down, buddy, right on the seat. And don't lean forward. </p>
                    
                    
                    <p>Of course, I am writing this from the throne. </p>

                    <h2>What a shame</h2>
                </header>

                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>I still can't tell the difference between someone who is aware of their mask, and someone who isn't, and someone who is aware of it but in denial about it, and those pleasant people who can take one off and put on a new one when it's called for.</p>

                    <p>There's a guy at work who definitely doesn't see it. He's all structure and form. "This is not appropriate behaviour for the workplace" he said this one time. We're creatives - how could you draw that line? I respect him though, he's really good at getting people to clean up after themselves.</p>

                    <p>I used to be so afraid of authority - afraid of disappointing people, really. In high school, I wouldn't have been caught dead breaking the rules. I was always an overachiever, not because I had too, but because to disappoint the teacher or my parents would have been absolutely, utterly, bone-rattlingly devastating. Recognition from an authority meant everything to me. Shame is a powerful motivator. </p>

                    <p>Then little by little, the veil fell apart. Looking back, I'd have to place the seed of my disillusionment in my frustrations against referees during the hockey games of my early teens. I used to howl and wile out at these refs. They were only kids, barely older than I. But they were so bad at their jobs; and people in positions of authority failing to mete out justice were, to this young teen, the worst kinds of people. Absolute frauds. </p>

                    <p>I'd get so uncharacteristically violent and outspoken during these games. Yelling turned into overly aggressive checking and punching. In all other facets, I was a sweet, innocent boy.</p>

                    <p>Then I came to despise the 'greater institutions.' The university was one. Being taught by professors who could barely speak English sent my temper flying. This was supposed to be an institution where I come to learn and the people teaching had no teaching skills at all. How the fuck does that make sense? I wrote a rant about it on the Blackberry I used at the time; I can't find it anymore. The gist of it had to do with the fact that I was being ordered to take the 'serious' people seriously, when all I could see were clowns. </p>

                    <p>It was 2013; I was 19. I complained about it to my dad, just like I had complained so many times before about those referees. His response: "That's just the way things are. What are you gonna do, change the world?" </p>
                    <p>I didn't know what I was going to do. I stayed in school and I'm not sure how my thinking evolved in the aftermath. I am sure I became terribly sick though. My digestive track fell apart. </p>

                    <p>I guess I'm on a quest to recover that wildly outspoken boy who never failed to give the referees a piece of his mind. Or at least recover the ability to express a momentary thought or emotion without worrying about being pinned down by it. Unrestrained emoting felt so good.  These days the idea of externalizing anything inside my head is a non-starter.</p>

                    <h2>Funny bone</h2>
                </header>

                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>On this day I plant my flag on the barren moon that is this website, one of quadrillions of others orbiting a planet too massive and self-centered for any one voice to influence even its tides, let alone a single person living there. It's okay; I don't do it for them, I do it for me. I do it because I want to remember. </p>

                    <p>Yesterday my girlfriend asked me whether I could remember our first date. I can't even remember our most recent one. What I can remember, however, are the fights and hiccups that lead us here. It's not fun; to only have memories of the dark and dreadful. But sometimes I think that's all my brain can hold onto. And its not just with my girlfriend. Everything I can recall, everything with which I can hope to build an identity is shrouded in darkness. The story I tell myself about myself, at least as I tell it to myself now and have been so telling myself for the past year, is just one of struggle against oppression, pathology, and disease: there's the struggle against the evil and unjust politicians and systems we are apart of, a struggle against my own hangups caused by a past I imagine to be full of negativity, a battle against an illness caused by an ineffable mix of factors. And the overcoming that emerges from these struggles does not provide relief. All I achieve, all I get out of these struggles is the bare minimum, a bit of sanity and normalcy. There is nothing to be proud of.</p>

                    <p>On top of that, having a memory like this isn't conducive to friendships and genuine conmections. When the only thing you can recall from your interactions with others are the criticisms, embarassing moments, and jokes you weren't in on, you don't end up with the motivation to pursue these things. Don't get me wrong, the pleasant moments are there - they occured. I know that they did. I know that I was there to experience them. I just don't remember them. All I remember is a glass-like fragility and harshness to every exchange. Hollow words that were spoken and that vibrated my head as though they struck its funny bone. </p>

                    <p>And don't get me doubly wrong. I do love my friends. I'm trying really hard to show them this in a way they can understand. I'm trying really hard to do more of it because I know it's ultimately good for me... and them! It's just an uphill battle. I've gotten so much better about it. But I can tell in their faces sometimes that they're suspicious of me. They don't think I care genuinely; they think that my friendship is temporary. Maybe if I write it all down, focusing especially on the good, maybe I'll prove them (and myself) wrong about me. </p>

                        <p>I'm so fucking terrified of everything. My supervisor, my friends, women, myself. I hear myself say things and immediately think "what a fucking dumb thing to say". I witness a thought appear and I'm already on top of it, beating it down for existing. My loudest voice is the one that demands silence. "Don't say anything. Don't exist, not even as a thought. Shut it down."</p>

        <p>I can't even bring this up with my therapist. The thought of doing so engages all the defense mechanisms I'm trying to get rid of. "You're being so dramatic. You don't believe what you're about to say. D'you know how abused you'd have to be for this to be true about you?"</p>

        <p>There it is: the thought that I'm overly self-critical is met with hyper(meta?)-self-criticism. "You're an idiot for thinking that you're overly self-critical."</p>

        <p>I'm going to bring it up with him anyway. I'll just read it - I'll definitely accompany it with all the same caveats.</p>

        <p>He'll want evidence, presumably. Here I go again looking for justifications for my feelings and preferences. Let's oblige the dysfunction.</p>

        <p>First, I'm sitting at work writing this because I've been obsessed with journaling for the past week. I'd be crying if I were at home - that's how intense the feeling is right now, that's how true it feels for me. Remember that for when you stone-facedly report it to your therapist.</p>

        <p>I haven't worked in three weeks.</p>

        <p>Here's another one: It has become hard to even listen to music - the thing I love most in the world - because it's a reminder that I gave up being a musician out of fear and self-abnegation.</p>

        <p>This feels so performative. Maybe because I spend too much time in an area of the internet where everyone else also seems to feel this way. There I go making excuses again.</p>

        <p>Five minutes later, and I feel fine. So why mention it at all? It only comes in short hiccups throughout the week. Nothing worthy of reporting.</p>

        <p>Next Wednesday is a long ways away.</p>

                        [TRANSLATION_MODULE_ACTIVATED]<br><br>
                        <p>I haven't done any dissertation work for the past two weeks. Normally I'd be okay with this. I tend to work 7-days a week year-round, so the occasional break feels acceptable. But as of today I'm feeling a strange kind of guilt about not working. It's not enough to get me to start working again but definitely enough to prevent me from doing the other stuff I enjoy. I'm left sitting at my desk, shuffling my seriously worn-out deck of cards, and waiting for my brain to start tickling again.</p>

        <p>The problem is that this time, I'm feeling a subtle amount of dread that I can't quite place. I am used to saying so ironically, but today it has hit me in the teeth with the genuine sting of a stepped-on rake: writing this PhD dissertation is the most soul-sucking, tedious, joyless thing ever - it's on the level of alphabetizing the files in the filing cabinets of the dusty and poorly lit storage room at your doctor's office - it connects me with nothing and no one at all, in fact it's the most alienating thing I've ever done.</p>

        <p>It's really worrisome. It feels like the re-emergence of a thought-pattern I thought I'd put to rest: the one where I obsess over something, burnout or get bored, realize it's not for me, change career path, repeat - all in the name of authentic living! It was me noticing this pattern that in part led me to commit so intently to pursuing a PhD. One modest existential crisis later, I realized that I had accomplished nothing with this MO. So I got out of the rut by committing myself to a pursuit that seemed larger than me, something I thought worthwhile. And since then this pursuit has been the all-supporting backdrop to my life, enabling me to manage the other perhaps more minor battles with authenticity that I've faced.</p>

        <p>That's the dread then, it's the terrifying possibility that what I thought was a permanent fixture - something that has kept me grounded - is finally fading away: What if this is a burnout warranting a total change of course? What if this career path was a mistake after all? (Is this what a breakup feels like?)</p>

        <p>Stating this out loud has made me realize how ridiculous the sentiment is. It has reminded me that almost every moment along this journey has been one filled with excitement, discoveries, epiphanies, about society, humanity, and history and even about myself. For the past five years, it has been true for me without question that I was destined for this. Isn't that enough to justify staying the course?</p>

        <p>Maybe it's framing with respect to authenticity that's what's screwing me over. Maybe it's time for some tough love. Here's a thought: this tedium that's now pressing itself into my face is just the price I have to pay for the privilege of pursuing this degree. What I am truly confronting now - this lull - is the fact that my <em>job</em> is take all these wonderful discoveries and weave them together into a coherent, readable text that other people can learn from. It's true that it's tedious but it is required - I should share my findings with others, I owe it to them - otherwise what am I to them? Probably just a selfish blob leeching off the system. Or the worst thing of all: a mere consumer. (High pitched scream in the distance.)</p>

        <p>So this <em>isn't</em> a battle with authenticity. Or maybe it's a need to reconfigure the basis for authenticity. The fact of the matter is that if I am inferring from my boredom that I've chosen the wrong path because the correct - authentic - one could never make me feel like this then I am making a huge selfish mistake. Wait a minute - have I been doing this my whole life? Have I been masquerading my lack of productivity, my constant changes in direction, as a quest for authenticity, when it's really an unconscious drive to absorb the world while contributing nothing?</p>

        <p>That seems too harsh. I can admit that authenticity is important to me and has driven me towards this awesome fulfilling career while also admitting I'm part of a community, one that I care about and need to care for. In fact, this realization helps a lot: I now have a new reason to share my findings - to share any of my creations really - that doesn't come from the mere selfish desire to be recognized as a creator. I have a duty to share which stems from a desire to <em>not</em> be selfish - a duty to contribute and not merely consume.</p>

        <p>I need to think this over more. One thing that sticks is that if I'm always dipping my toe in a ton of different hobbies without giving back, then I'm really nothing good for my community.</p>

        <p>So this is something new to latch onto: I should ground my motivation to finish the things I start in duty to share my creations and to contribute.</p>

                         <p>I now have a favorite tree. I discovered it while walking through the cemetery neighboring my apartment building. The building and cemetery are part of a relatively small bundle of apartment buildings and houses sprawling on top a hill overlooking the Costco. I don't think I'm doxing myself by saying it's called Mount Pleasant Cemetery.</p>

        <p>I like to say I live in this cemetery. Both because the apartment buildings themselves are lined up like tombstones and because eighty percent of the tenants here are seniors. Also because of the cemetery.</p>

        <p>The tree is an Eastern Red Cedar. I had to look up that name. The bark is really grey and feels soft, like it would peel off easily if you pulled, and the scales are a cool shade of faded blue. I think it's now my favorite shade of blue. What's special about the one in the cemetery is that it has none of the symmetry of those you find in images on the internet. There's a long stretch of bare trunk before the branches split off haphazardly. It's definitely been the victim of several wind storms. If I had a house with a backyard, I'd have a bunch of these trees. Maybe I'd deliberately break off some of its branches to reproduce the look I like. And the whole backyard would be wild and overgrown with rough path carpeted in rusting pine needles. I'd want it to feel like you're deep in a northern forest.</p>

        <p>There's a brown tombstone here from 1879 with a name I can't make out. It has been here too long for anyone to still be bringing it flowers. Instead, a bunch of mushrooms have started to grow out of the earth surrounding it. It feels appropriate. It's what I'd want. Nobody bring me flowers when I'm gone. Instead, break up the mycelium of your favorite mushroom and mix it into the earth above me. Find some colorful ones.</p>
        <p>My brother-in-law owns an acreage. "Sixty-five Acres." He spends all his free time chiseling away at it. This includes flattening a whole area to dig himself small lake where the kids can swim. He threw in some fish to keep it vibrant. It's one of my favorite places to be. When they first moved in, I helped him clear out some of the many four-wheeler trails that had become overgrown from neglect by the previous owner. He has a habit of clearing out everything including the old stumps that aren't obviously in the way. If they're small and decayed enough, he'll yank them out with his bare hands. I've seen him pressure-wash a boulder. Boulders are actually quite beautiful.</p>
